# Smoky-Skies-Redux    
A steampunk Unciv mod based on Empires of the Smoky Skies. Build airships and conquer the world!

[Empires of the Smoky Skies](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Empires_of_the_Smoky_Skies_\(Civ5\)), first brought to Unciv through the efforts of [k4zoo](https://github.com/k4zoo/EmpireOfSmokySkies), now updated by myself to ensure compatibility with the latest Unciv code. Build your airships, mine your Luboric, and conquer the world!
