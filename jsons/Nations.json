The debates soon reached a critical mass for action, fueled by the nobles’ fear of an uncertain future as well as their desire to protect their wealth. A secret council was formed, drawing on the leadership and military prowess that had been their inheritance from previous generations. It mobilized a small but well-equipped army. With it, the nobles carved out a large territory that would become the core of Eruch, and seceded from the old kingdoms.",

Soon leaders arose from the ranks of the refugees, calling for organization, protection, food, and resources. Some nobles saw opportunity and joined their ranks, sharing their wealth.
